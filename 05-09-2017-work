#Update the Cloud SDK and install the Endpoints components:
gcloud components update

#Make sure that Cloud SDK (gcloud) is authorized to access your data and services on Google Cloud Platform:
gcloud auth login

#Set the default project to your project ID:
gcloud config set project expense-tracker-178909

#Configuring Endpoints

The sample includes the Endpoints Frameworks tool that generates an OpenAPI configuration file that describes the sample code's REST API. Follow the steps in this section to configure and build the sample Maven project so that you can then generate the OpenAPI configuration file.
Adding the project ID to the sample API code

You must add the project ID obtained when you created your Cloud project to the sample's pom.xml before you can deploy the code.

To add the project ID:

    Edit the file java-docs-samples/appengine/endpoints-frameworks-v2/backend/pom.xml.

    Search for <endpoints.project.id>, and replace the value YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your Cloud project ID.

    For example:

    <endpoints.project.id>example-project</endpoints.project.id>

#Building the sample project
mvn package clean

#Generating the OpenAPI configuration file

You use a tool from the Frameworks library to generate an OpenAPI configuration file called openapi.json. This file describes the sample code's REST API.

To generate the OpenAPI configuration file:

    Invoke the Endpoints Frameworks tool using this command:

     mvn exec:java -DGetSwaggerDoc

    Wait for the configuration spec to build. When it finishes you'll see a message similar to this one:

     OpenAPI document written to ./openapi.json

    Ignore any messages about failure to load a static logger class.


#Deploying the Endpoints configuration

To deploy the Endpoints configuration, you use Google Service Management, an infrastructure service of Google Cloud Platform that manages other APIs and services, including services created using Cloud Endpoints.

To deploy the configuration file:

    Make sure you are in the directory java-docs-samples/appengine/endpoints-frameworks-v2/backend

    Deploy the OpenAPI configuration file that was generated in the previous section by invoking the following command:

     gcloud service-management deploy openapi.json

This creates a new Cloud Endpoints service with the name in the format YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com. This name is configured in pom.xml and other configuration files included in the sample. Note that when you deploy the API on App Engine, a DNS record is created using the name format PROJECT_ID.appspot.com, which is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you use when you send requests to the API.

As it is creating and configuring the service, Service Management outputs a great deal of information to the terminal. You can safely ignore the warnings about the paths in openapi.json not requiring an API key. On successful completion, you will see a line like the following that displays the service configuration ID and the service name:
